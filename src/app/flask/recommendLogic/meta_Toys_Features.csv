B00005BZD5,"A soothing alternative to a wind-up nighttime musical toy, this soft  plush sleeping Pooh, accompanied by his best friend Piglet, can be placed in a  corner of the crib and controlled by remote. Playing the music from a distance  means no more sneaking in to rewind a toy and possibly disturb the baby. Pooh is  dressed in a blue nightcap and snuggles on a small pillow, which is a plastic  music unit covered with cotton. It has a soft flashing light inside and there is  an on/off switch underneath. When pressed, Pooh's familiar voice sings a  lullaby. The blue plastic remote activates one of three choices--soft, tinkling  classical music, a Pooh song, or chirping birds and nature sounds. Parents will  need to decide if the hard plastic pillow unit is a safe choice for their child.  The unit comes with three AA batteries, but three more are required for the  remote.--Marianne Painter",Sing Me to Sleep Pooh,199.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41820VBKYHL._SX300_.jpg,,"'Toys & Games', 'Baby & Toddler Toys', 'Stuffed Animals & Toys'"," 'music', 'son', 'volume.if child', 'husband', 'minute'"

B000EULXAM,"There&#x92;s nothing like watching small children fall in love with music. This baby grand will play Cupid to a toddler&#x92;s relationship to music. Just the right size for little fingers, with bright colors, lights, and familiar songs and learning concepts; kids will need no introduction before getting in there and starting to tickle those ivories! Three modes of play encourage children to enjoy music, learn basic concepts (alphabet, counting, opposites, etc.), or just play notes and chords on the eight-key keyboard. A plastic songbook (built into the piano) uses numerals on musical notation to teach aspiring musicians the correlation between the sounds they hear, the notes on the page, and the keys on the keyboard. Slides and buttons and dials can be manipulated to adjust tempo, pitch, and style, while a metronome keeps time. And a friendly maestro monster looms over the piano, dancing as your artiste creates composes her or his opuses. The music, as with so many children&#x92;s toys, is moderately unpleasant&#x97;nursery rhymes meet lounge jazz&#x97;but not the worst you&#x92;ll ever hear. And the joy toddlers will get out of playing their own melodies, as well as the potential for learning, far outweighs the burden of listening to cheesy tunes. Or you can just keep it in note-playing mode, and skip the pre-recorded tunes altogether! Three ""C"" batteries required (not included).

But this pony is much more than your standard rocking horse: it is also the actual controller for the included educational video games.After some quick-and-easy adult assembly (you'll need a Philips screwdriver) and battery insertion (you'll need three AAA batteries and three C batteries), we found it easy to start playing right away. Just plug the included receiver into your television, VCR, or DVD player's audio/video input jacks, and the game introductory screen will appear on the TV. Using wireless technology, the pony's motions control the video games. Your child can bounce and spin while riding the pony to interact with the ""learning sites,"" or games, that she chooses to play.We found the wireless technology very convenient: we could put the pony anywhere from 3 to 15 feet from the receiver. That said, we discovered that, as recommended, the pony should be positioned on a carpeted surface, since it slides relatively easily on hardwood floors or other smooth flooring material.Games That Grow With Your ChildThe educational games feature simple, colorful animation that's easy for a small child to relate to, as well as perky, bright background music and fun sing-along songs. (Adult caregivers will appreciate that the potentially relentless background music can be shut off during play.) The child causes the animated features to react by bouncing on the pony and turning the drum on the pony's handle.The Smart Bounce &amp; Spin Pony's five learning sites include: A to Z Zoo; Count &amp; Grow Farm; Colorful Home; Shapes at Shore; and Opposites Playground. Each game can be played at 1 of 3 levels of advancement, which can be selected by an adult using buttons on the receiver.Level 1 teaches the youngest toddler about action and reaction. For example, in level 1 of the ""Colorful Home"" game, a puppy appears on the screen and simply makes motions whenever the pony bounces.Level 2 introduces letters, shapes, numbers, and colors. For example, in level 2 of the A to Z Zoo, each letter of the alphabet appears as the pony bounces, with the onscreen voice naming the letter.Level 3 allows children to ""count along,"" and works with ideas like opposites and spelling. In level 3 of the Count &amp; Grow Farm, for example, the child makes an animal jump over consecutively numbered hurdles and is encouraged to count along with the game. Spinning the drum on the pony's handle creates additional effects, such as playing new songs or changing the weather in the scene.Stand Alone ModeThe child can change the game herself with arrow buttons on the pony's handle. If the child stops bouncing, after a short period a pony appears on the screen reminds the child to bounce and get the game going again. It will go into ""sleep mode"" after three minutes to preserve battery life. Just turn the drum or bounce the pony to start it up again.Smaller children will especially like that the pony can be played with by itself without the video games. Change the pony's switch to ""stand alone mode,"" and the pony will play its own music while the child bounces and spins. In fact, in our estimation the stationary mode is best for the youngest toddler -- and only with lots of adult help.While our 22-month-old child tester found it very easy to mount, dismount, and ride the pony, most 12-month old children will not be able to balance safely on it, let alone bounce and spin independently, unless they have prodigy-like athletic abilities.What's in the BoxSmart Bounce &amp; Spin Pony with base and handlebar; receiver",Fisher-Price Laugh &amp; Learn Smart Bounce &amp; Spin Pony,144.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314d%2BFeDTpL._SY300_.jpg,Fisher-Price,"'Toys & Games', 'Tricycles, Scooters & Wagons', 'Ride-On Toys'"," 'son', 'work', 'tv', 'tv', 'money', 'driveway'"

B0018N5V3Y,"With the Strider PREbike, there are no ""tricycle tip-overs"" or ""training-wheel wobbles"" to create a fear, hesitancy, or dislike of bike riding. The Strider running bike helps toddlers learn balance and coordination before pedaling, which develops glittering confidence. Designed for children, ages 1 to 5, the Strider running bike holds several advantages over ordinary beginner's bikes.The Strider teaches your child balance, coordination and develops glittering confidence. Trikes and bikes with training wheels don't. Traditional bicycles place too much of the focus on learning to pedal--skimping on developing your child's motor skills. And tricycles are heavy, clunky and difficult for kids to control.Bike riding becomes a breeze when you teach your child balance and coordination before pedaling. The Strider takes pedaling out of the mix so that kids can concentrate solely on learning balance, which takes more practice. Pedaling is a secondary skill that kids can easily learn within a few short minutes.Pure Fun, Right Out of the BoxIf your child can walk... your child can ride a Strider. Even tiny little children, before the age of two, are drawn to the Strider. At first, kids will grab the handle bars, straddle the bike and walk without ever sitting down on the seat. And they're completely stable: Two wheels, front and back. Feet firmly on the ground. Hands bracing the handle bars.Here's an added benefit for parents: Your child will become more mobile. The Strider opens up a whole world for your child to ride on. Take your child's Strider to an outdoor gathering, a nearby park, or anywhere else you walk. With a Strider, there's no more dawdling little one's. Your child will easily be able to keep pace.The next step: Kids quickly learn to sit down, push with their feet and zip right along as they balance on two wheels.A Safer Way to Learn Bike RidingTricycles tip over, scrape ankles, and are difficult to pedal. Bicycles with training wheels are tall, heavy, unstable and downright scary for young riders. Both have the potential to cause painful injuries and fear. The Strider PREbike is free from any cables, chains, sprockets, pedals or protrusions that can harm your child. And the Strider is steady, stable and safe. At the first feeling of instability, your child will instinctively place both feet securely on the ground. So there are no ""tricycle tip-overs"" or ""training-wheel wobbles"" that stir-up a fear, hesitancy, or dislike of bike riding.The Strider's lightweight design and low center of gravity make it easy to maneuver and control, giving your child a safe and secure feeling. And the bike's adjustable seat height starts at 11 inches from the ground, accommodating the shortest of legs. Control is further enhanced with a low and flat handlebar design. Kids can now reach forward rather than up, which gives them better leverage and maneuverability. And as the your child becomes more confident, the Strider's integrated foot rests provide a place for both feet while coasting along.Specifications:Weight:Less that 7 pounds (about 1/3 the weight of a typical 12-inch pedal bike with training wheels).Frame Design:Unique frame design has integrated Launch Pad footrests for gliding and learning advanced riding skills.Tires:Puncture-proof all-terrain tires with sealed bearings and 5/16-inch steel axles.Construction:Durable welded steel frame and handlebarsWarranty:1 year warranty against manufacturing defectsSizing:Adjustable handlebar and seat height to fit riders from 30 to 44 inches tall (saddle height adjusts from 11 to 16 inches from ground).

B001PO1OFU,"The Kettler name has been synonymous with top quality wheel toys for kids for more than 40 years, and the Kettler Kettrike Junior Tricycle is no exception to the Kettler quality and design standards. The frame is constructed with high-carbon steel to last a lifetime and a fade-resistant polyester powder-coat finish with sturdy molded plastic components. Designed to grow with your child, the brightly colored Kettrike Junior Trike will provide boys and girls with years of fun through multiple stages of development from one year old through six years old. With the included removable chrome-plated push bar, the Kettrike Junior Trike evolves from a parent-directed ride-on toy to an independently operated tricycle, all the while growing in size along with your child.The Kettrike Junior Trike has a four-position telescoping frame with one bolt release so it can grow with your child or be used by multiple children. The four-position adjustable high-back seat with a handhold is appropriate and supportive enough for one year olds and sturdy for rough-riding four year olds. The parent-operated chrome-plated push bar allows kids to ride and enjoy the trike long before they learn to pedal, as young as 12 months old or as soon as they can grip the handles. The push bar can be removed easily as soon as your child is ready to pedal on his own.As your child grows he or she will be able to reach and operate the pedals, first with the guidance of an adult helping with the push bar, and eventually on his or her own. Pedaling the trike helps kids build confidence and leg strength as they explore independently. Designed to be safe for young riders, the Kettrike Junior has wide synthetic MaxXtread tires that provide excellent traction for all-terrain riding and are super stable. The trike has a low center of gravity and limited turn radius steering that restricts the handlebars and front wheel from turning more than 45 degrees to the left or right, radically reducing the danger of tipping over. The trike is also equipped with a fun rear-tipping bucket that is great for both carrying and collecting supplies and is easy to remove and clean when necessary. The Kettler Kettrike Junior Tricycle is a standout toy for both its quality and its longevity.Specifications:Recommended ages: 1 to 6 years oldFour-position telescoping frame with one bolt releaseFour-position adjustable high-back seat with hand holdChrome-plated push bar includedHigh-carbon steel frameFade-resistant polyester powder-coat finishLimited turn radius steering deviceSynthetic MaxXtread tires for a smooth and quiet rideRemovable tipping bucketDimensions: 21 x 20 x 23 inches (HxWxD)Seat: 10 inches highSeat to floor distance: 10 inchesSeat to pedal distance: 16 inches to 20.5 inches (to measure sit child on floor, bend knee up slightly, measure from hip to heel)Wheel size: 9"" / 7""Weight limit: 200 poundsAssembly requiredWhat's in the Box?Tricycle and components, chrome-plated pushbarManufacturer WarrantyThree-year limited manufacturer's warranty",Kettrike Junior,119,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lWbdhNCsL._SX300_.jpg,Kettler,"'Toys & Games', 'Tricycles, Scooters & Wagons', 'Ride-On Toys'"," 'trike', 'bike', 'problem', 'trike', 'pedal', 'son', 'husband'"

Designed to help babies and young toddlers develop spatial awareness, balance, and gross motor skills, the Pewi provides both a ""sit on"" walker and a walking aid push toy. As soon as babies can pull up to stand and begin to take steps, the Pewi can be used as a stable push toy for walking practice. Thanks to the Pewi's wide and long base, the toy won't flip over when the child leans into it.Children large enough to sit on the seat with their feet on the floor can use the Pewi like a traditional walker. But, in contrast to traditional walkers, the Pewi requires children to find their own balance, developing trunk muscles and developing spatial awareness as they play. For bigger kids, the Pewi is a fun foot to floor ride-on with a maximum load capacity of 44 pounds. The multi direction caster wheels allow a child to ride and easily control the Pewi in any direction. With non marking rubber wheels, the Pewi will not damage or mark floors making it equally suitable for use for indoors or outdoors on smooth play surfaces.
